# Risk Manager

The risk manager is a key component within a trading system. It is used to monitor risk metrics, monitor shutdown signals, monitor health of the system, and much more.

Our risk manager connects to our trading UI via the [risk database](TODO). It polls the risk database frequently to monitor any changes within risk metrics or shutdown signals.
